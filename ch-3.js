//////////////// Challenge - 3

// All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish.

//There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name.

//For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.

// Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and

// returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.

// Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters.

//beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.
